	<summary>

	<summary>
 OnPaint will go through the enabled elements (vertical ReminderMessage, GridLines, LineNumbers, BorderLines, MarginLines) and will
 draw them if enabled. At the same time, it will build GraphicsPaths for each of those elements (that are enabled), which will be used 
 in SeeThroughMode (if it's active): the figures in the GraphicsPaths will form a customized outline for the control by setting them as the 
 Region of the LineNumber control. Note: the vertical ReminderMessages are only drawn during designtime.
